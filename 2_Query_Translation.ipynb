    "The main idea behind the Query Translation is that translate the user query in a way that the LLM can correctly answer the question. For instance, if the user asks an ambiguous question, our RAG rretriever might retrieve incorrect (or ambiguous) documents based on the embeddings that are not very relevant to answer the user question, leading the LLM to hallucinate answers. There are few ways to tackle this problem. Some of them are,\n",

    "- [Step-back prompting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06117): This involves encouraging the LLM to take a step back from a given question or problem and pose a more abstract, higher-level question that encompasses the essence of the original inquiry.\n",
    "- [Least-to-most prompting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.10625): This allows to break down a complex problem into a series of simpler subproblems and then solve them in sequence Solving each subproblem is facilitated by the answers to previously solved subproblems.\n",

Beacuse the each individual rank would help us to decide the top-k documents to selcect as the context if we have a huge number of documents with a limited context window of the LLM. Therefore in RAG Fusion, while we do exactly the same thing upto retrieving docuemnts, we use [Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/hybrid-search-ranking) to rank the each retrieved docuemnt before using them as the context to answer our original question.

       "'QLoRA is a technology used to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of instruction following and chatbot performance across multiple datasets and model types. It is an efficient adaptation strategy that neither introduces inference latency nor reduces input sequence length while retaining high model quality. It allows for quick task-switching when deployed as a service by sharing the vast majority of the model parameters. It is generally applicable to any neural networks with dense layers. QLoRA can be seen as an equalizing factor that helps to close the resource gap between large corporations and small teams with consumer GPUs. It might enable the critical milestone of enabling the finetuning of LLMs on phones and other low resource settings.'"
