    "The main idea behind the Query Transformation is that translate/transform the user query in a way that the LLM can correctly answer the question. For instance, if the user asks an ambiguous question, our RAG retriever might retrieve incorrect (or ambiguous) documents based on the embeddings that are not very relevant to answer the user question, leading the LLM to hallucinate answers. There are few ways to tackle this problem. Some of them are,\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Step-back prompting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06117): This involves encouraging the LLM to take a step back from a given question or problem and pose a more abstract, higher-level question that encompasses the essence of the original inquiry.\n",
    "- [Least-to-most prompting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.10625): This allows to break down a complex problem into a series of simpler subproblems and then solve them in sequence. Solving each subproblem is facilitated by the answers to previously solved subproblems.\n",

    "In the default multi-query approach, after we retrieved the relevant documents for each question generated for our original question, we take the union of all the documents to select only unique documents (same document can be retrieved by multiple questions). However, we did not pay attention to the rank of each docuemnt in the context, which is important for the LLM to produce the most correct answer. Beacuse the each individual rank would help us to decide the top-k documents to select as the context if we have a huge number of documents with a limited context window of the LLM. Therefore in RAG Fusion, while we do exactly the same thing upto retrieving docuemnts, we use [Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/hybrid-search-ranking) to rank the each retrieved document before using them as the context to answer our original question.

       "'The benefits of QLoRA include:\\n\\n1. Reduced Memory Footprint: QLoRA uses quantization to reduce the average memory footprint, allowing for more efficient use of memory resources. This is particularly beneficial when working with large models that require significant memory.\\n\\n2. Management of Memory Spikes: QLoRA employs Paged Optimizers to manage memory spikes, ensuring smooth operation even with large models. This enhances the stability and reliability of the model training process.\\n\\n3. Detailed Analysis: QLoRA has been used to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of instruction following and chatbot performance across multiple datasets and model types. This allows for a comprehensive understanding of model performance and can guide further improvements.\\n\\n4. Handling Large Model Scales: QLoRA can handle model scales that would be infeasible to run with regular finetuning, such as 33B and 65B parameter models. This expands the range of models that can be finetuned, opening up new possibilities for model development.\\n\\n5. Equalizing Resource Gap: QLoRA can be seen as an equalizing factor that helps to close the resource gap between large corporations and small teams with consumer GPUs. This democratizes access to advanced model finetuning, fostering innovation and competition.\\n\\n6. Enabling Finetuning on Low Resource Settings: QLoRA has the potential to enable the finetuning of large language models on phones and other low resource settings. This makes advanced model finetuning more accessible and versatile, potentially expanding the range of applications for these models.'"
